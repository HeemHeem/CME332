Tasks required
3 periodic tasks: engine, I/O, vehicle

Engine Task:
- responsible for throttle based on input status and vehicle speed

I/O Task:
- responsible for handling inputs to the system, and displaying outputs to the user. This task does not modify any of the properties

Vehicle task:
-responsible for acceleration and speed of vehicle based on input and external factor. also modifies the location of the vehicle acccording to the acceleration of the speed

constraints engine tasks:
- engine must be turned on in order to generate force to accelerate the vehicle. Engine status and gear position are handle by I/O task
- if accelerator is depressed, a constant throttle of 6
- throttle reponse time should be made minimal
- to start the engine: (1) key fob is inside vehicle; (2) step on brake; and (3) press and hold the engine start/stop button for longer than 1 second
- to turn engine off: (1) gear is in park; (2) press the engine start/stop button
- to keep the vehicle model simple, engine cannot be turned off during driving

constraints vehicle tasks:
- if brake pedal is not depressed, input acceleration of the vehicle is equal too acceleration = 0.5 x throttle
- if brake pedal is depressed, it overriedes the accelerator and the input acceleration is set to -6m/s^2 until speed reaches 0
- new speed is calculated by new_speed = speed + acceleration x time
- if neither accelerator and brake is depressed, speed is unchanged

constraints on I/O:
- I/O tasks records the status of the inputs for the engine task to reference to
- I/O tasks updates vehicle speed (from the vehicle task) on HEX2-HEX0.

additional constraints:
- periodic intterupts must be generated by using an interval timer. all other interrupts are disabled
- the system should be able to check frame-overrun at the beginning of each frame. LEDG8 should be turned on and stay on if there is a frame overrun
- a text file
